                Hi, my name is Tatiana. I am driven DACA recipient and have overcome many obstacles to obtain an
                education in this country. I take great pride in my work and inspiring other women and immigrants that
                anything is possible. Over the years, I have gained an extensive and professional experience in the
                service industry and also have a background in marketing, causing me to a to have a deeply empathetic
                understanding of people and their needs. My work ethic, resilience, and communication skills help me
                greatly as a researcher. I have always been drawn to art and my creative mindset is what drives me to
                love UX and UI design. Ideally, I would like to work remote, but have no issue with working in office.
                My ideal type of client would be a creative or artistic atmosphere, but I also have great respect for
                charity and government application and website redesigns.

                <h3> User Research </h3>
                <p>
                    User research is interesting, because it gives me a chance to brainstorm, create, and envision the
                    user as a real person, rather than just a consumer though proto personas.

                <h3> User Empathy </h3>
                <p>
                    As someone who has worked in the service and hospitality industry for ten years, empathising towards
                    other peopleâ€™s wants and needs comes very naturally to me. Using user journey maps and affinity
                    diagrams is crucial for this aspect.

                <h3> Qualitative Interviews </h3>
                <p>
                    Interviews are probably, my favorite part of the process, because it gives me a chance to discover
                    different perspectives that I had not known of initially.
